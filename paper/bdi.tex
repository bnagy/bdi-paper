    This paper describes an update to the open-source Python implementation of the General Imposters
    method of authorship verification by Mike Kestemont et al. The new algorithm, called Bootstrap
    Distance Imposters (henceforth BDI), incorporates several of the improvements proposed since the
    code was last updated in 2015, as well as introducing a novel method of bootstrapping that has
    several attractive properties when compared to the reference algorithm. Initially, we supply an
    updated version of the Kestemont et al. code (for Python 3.x) which incorporates the same basic
    improvements. Next, the two approaches are benchmarked using the problems from the PAN 2014
    author identification task \cite{pan_2014}, and some additional properties of BDI are showcased
    via real-world verification studies. BDI is shown to be a high-precision (few false positives)
    method for authorship verification, with competitive overall performance, and significant
    advantages in interpretability.

\section{Introduction}

A common task in the field of stylometry is to attempt to resolve questions of authorship. Since the
answers to these questions can have important repercussions, whether legal, literary, or social, it
is important that the methods employed by practitioners be reliable; but in order for the results to
be believed they should also be transparent and interpretable. The General Imposters method
(henceforth GI), originally formulated by Koppel and Winter in \cite{koppel_gi}, has become one of
the standard methods in stylometry for authorship verification. After strong performances in
the PAN 2013 and 2014 competitions, it was implemented and used by M. Kestemont et al. in an
influential study \cite{kestemont_caesar}, improved by Potha and Stamatatos in 2017
\cite{potha_improved_gi}, and is now available in the well-known R package \emph{stylo}
\cite{stylo}.

In this paper I describe an update to the open-source Python implementation by Kestemont et al.
\cite{kestemont_ruzicka} called Bootstrap Distance Imposters (henceforth BDI) which incorporates
several of the improvements proposed since the last release, as well as introducing a novel method
of bootstrapping that has several attractive properties when compared to the reference algorithm.
The two approaches are benchmarked using the problems from the PAN 2014 author identification task
\cite{pan_2014}, and some additional properties are showcased via real-world case studies.

    \label{fig:gibdi}
\end{figure*}

The Imposters method of authorship verification examines a \emph{question text} in order to
determine whether the text was written by a \emph{candidate author}. To do this, it performs
bootstrap comparisons of the question text to candidate texts and several (perhaps very many)
\emph{imposter texts} which should ideally be chosen to be similar in genre, topic and register. If
the question text is markedly more similar to the candidate author's `style' than to any of the
imposters then we infer, with some level of statistical likelihood, that it was authored by the
candidate. The method of Imposters can be used with any features that reflect style, although it is
most commonly applied to distances between character $n$-gram or word frequency vectors.

Note that while I speak of `statistical likelihood' I am carefully avoiding the words `probability'
and `confidence'. The GI method is, in machine learning terms, an ensemble classifier. These
classifiers regularise well, but while they produce a real-valued output, it is problematic to
interpret this number as a probability. Many factors can make the verification results less
reliable---the lengths of the texts, the language in which they are written, the closeness of the
imposter texts (dissimilar texts make a positive attribution less convincing), and the amount of
available data (a lack of comparison data risks bias). Verification problems in the real world are
seldom under ideal conditions, and there is no magical formula by which the uncertainties imposed by
the problem setting can be convincingly rendered as a forensic probability. Never the less, the
Imposters method has a well deserved reputation for robust, understandable results, even in the face
of severe limitations (for example in the length of samples or the availability of suitable
imposters).

Figure \ref{fig:gibdi} attempts an intuitive explanation of the basic operation of standard GI and
the key modification used in BDI. The output of the Kestemont GI classifier is a percentage of
binarized `votes' (the number of times a candidate text was closer than an imposter). In contrast,
the raw output from the BDI algorithm is a bootstrapped distribution of differences. At each step,
the distance (with a bootstrapped feature set) between the candidates and the imposters is recorded,
using any vector distance measure $d: \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. If
the candidates are further, the difference between the distances is negative, if closer it is
positive. If these individual distances follow a Gaussian distribution (which is a reasonable prior
expectation) then their difference is also Gaussian. Expressing the results this way has some
advantages. The first is that we can differentiate a negative result (not the candidate) as either
`none of the above' or `more like an imposter' (the true author is in the imposters set). A `none of
the above' result would have a statistically expected distance of zero (equally unlike the candidate
and the imposters), and so we would see a distribution centred around 0.%
%
\footnote{ Note carefully that this is a one-way implication---a true author
    that is neither the candidate nor one of the imposters should have a
    distance distribution centred around zero, but not all such distributions
    guarantee that the true author is not among the imposters.}
%
On the other hand, `more like an imposter' results show distributions centred around a negative
value (examples of this can be seen in Section \ref{sec:showcase} below). The other advantage is
that for strong positives, we have additional data about the match. Distributions centred around
larger positive numbers are better matches, but distributions with high variance show more feature
dependence (since the strength of the match varies greatly depending on the bootstrap feature sets).
In summary, positive matches (with most or all of the probability mass above zero) can be much more
meaningfully compared.

It is worth noting here that the overall best performing method at PAN 2014 by Khonji and Iraqi
\cite{khonji_iraqi} also modified the classic GI algorithm to utilize the distance between vectors
(in that case the relative distance of the test vector to candidates vs imposters was considered as
part of the decision function for a `standard' voting-based classifier), so this paper is not the
first to recognise the value of this additional information.

\subsection{Classification Performance}

Based on the BDI algorithm, which outputs a distribution, it is obviously useful to have a summary
statistic that can be interpreted as evidence for authorship verification tasks. For this paper I
used a simple approach that considers the amount of probability mass that lies above 0. If every
test is closer to a candidate that an imposter then the result will be 1, if every test is more like
an imposter, it will be 0, etc. This is implemented as \texttt{(100-scipy.stats.percentileofscore(x,
    0)) / 100.0}, the inverse percentile of (a distance of) 0. Thus armed with a method that outputs a
`probability-like' result in $[0,1]$, I wrapped the code in a classifier that follows
\texttt{sklearn} \cite{scikit-learn} conventions like \texttt{fit()} and \texttt{predict\_proba()}
and evaluated the BDI classifier directly against the updated Kestemont GI \texttt{Order2Verifier},
using the 2014 PAN authorship verification problems. This provided a convenient benchmark, and also
the opportunity to compare the results against a number of other (although older) verification
approaches.

\subsection{Score Shifting}

The PAN 2014 competition provided a set of training problems, and the C@1 metric introduced in that
competition rewards (or at least penalises less harshly) classifiers that choose not to answer some
problems. This leads naturally to algorithms that use the training data to define classifier output
ranges that will be assigned to 0.5 (indicating an unanswered problem). In the case of classic GI,
this means that classifier scores (vote percentages) within certain ranges will be rectified to 0.5,
hopefully improving the C@1 score as compared to basic accuracy.

The score shifting method implemented in Kestemont GI attempts to produce something more like a
probability by linearly scaling the output values. The code defines an upper and lower bound for the
unanswered region, \texttt{p1} and \texttt{p2} The scaling code (in Python) looks like this:

\begin{minted}{python}
    for score in list(scores):
        if score <= p1:
            new_scores.append(rescale(score, min(scores), max(scores), 0.0, p1))
        elif score >= p2:
            new_scores.append(rescale(score, min(scores), max(scores), p2, 1.0))
        else:
            new_scores.append(0.5)
\end{minted}

Scores below \texttt{p1} are scaled to $[0,\texttt{p1})$, scores above \texttt{p2} are scaled to
            $(\texttt{p1},1]$, and the rest are coerced to 0.5. There is an issue with this scaling algorithm,
however. Since \texttt{p1} and \texttt{p2} are chosen by grid search to maximise the PAN score, the
score shifter sometimes fits values for \texttt{p2} that are well below 0.5. This can lead to
decisions that are defined as positive (since they are above \texttt{p2}) being scaled to below 0.5,
where they are evaluated by the scoring metrics as a negative result (and scored as such). In the
updated code, I modified the shifting code to scale more simply to $[0,0.5)$ (negative), 0.5
                (unanswered), and $(0.5,1]$ (positive). This does not retain the global distributional properties of
the original results (as implemented in \cite{kestemont_caesar}).

\begin{minted}{python}
    for score in scores: 
        if score <= p1: 
            new_scores.append( rescale(score, orig_min=0, orig_max=p1, new_min=0.0, new_max=0.499) ) 
        elif score >= p2: 
            new_scores.append( rescale(score, orig_min=p2, orig_max=1, new_min=0.501, new_max=1.0) )
        else: 
            new_scores.append(0.5)
\end{minted}

Based on the evaluation problems, the BDI algorithm is not as sensitive to this score shifting,
deriving only a modest benefit from fitting. The fitting process raises natural questions about the
representativeness of the training data, and also causes some problems in domains that suffer from
limited data availability (where it can be hard to sacrifice data for training). In these
circumstances, BDI works well with manual score shifting, allowing the user to choose a confidence
level based on first principles.

\subsection{Changes to Kestemont GI}

As is the nature of software, the code in the repository documenting the GI algorithm and for the
related work on the Caesarian corpus no longer ran. I reworked the code slightly, and made the
following small changes, which are available in my own repository \cite{nagy_ruzicka}.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Update the code to work with Python 3 (these minimal changes have been incorporated into
          the original repository based on a PR);
    \item Implement a fast `nini' metric (fuzzy Jaccard similarity) as described in \cite{nini_aa};
    \item Implement the Potha \& Stamatatos `ranking' improvement for the consensus score%
          %
          \footnote{ Instead of a strict 1 (candidate closest) or 0 (candidate not closest), Potha
              \& Stamatatos proposed a score improvement based on the ordinal rank of the closest
              candidate, so if a candidate was the second-closest, the score for that iteration
              would be $\frac{1}{2}$. The same paper proposed a distance-based culling method to
              select more relevant imposters, but this was not implemented (with enough
              bootstrapping this should converge)}
          %
          described in \cite{potha_improved_gi};
    \item Remove most non-core code;
    \item Modify the score-shifting algorithm, as described above.
\end{itemize}

\footnote{ There is a small inconsistency that I was unable to resolve---the only copy of the
    verification problems I could find were archived in the Kestemont repository, but they are
    apparently missing 50 of the `Dutch Reviews' evaluation problems, so there are a total of 746,
    versus 796 reported in the PAN 2014 wrapup report. }
%
For this test I used character $n$-grams, since that feature universe is a generally reliable and
uncontroversial choice for modern stylometric work. There may be feature universes that perform
better, or features that work better for a specific task, but character $n$-grams are `solid if
boring'. Likewise, the $n$-gram frequencies are $z$-scaled (based only on the training variances)
since this is the standard approach. I tested two $n$-gram configurations, 2,3,4-grams and
2,3,4,5-grams, 10,000 max features, with fitted and manual score shifting. For the
\texttt{Order2Verifier} bootstrapping was performed at 50\% (5000 random features per bootstrap
iteration) since that is the configuration used in \cite{kestemont_caesar}; for BDI bootstrapping
was performed at 33\%. Finally, for the distance metric used to determine `closeness' at each step I
tested the cosine distance (the most traditional choice) and the minmax (Ru≈æiƒçka) metric promoted by
Kestemont et al. in their original paper. Consistent with those results, the minmax metric appears
generally superior (see Table \ref{tab:micro}). The fully reproducible testing code is available in
the supplementary repository \cite{nagy_bdi_2024}.

\subsection{Interpretation}

As can be seen from Table \ref{tab:micro}, the performance of the BDI classifier is consistently
strong, with only a small boost in PAN score resulting from fitting the score shifter. The GI
\texttt{Order2Verifier} with a fitted shifter performs better according to the PAN metrics (deriving
a large C@1 benefit from fitting the score shifter). The updated GI classifier also appears to
outperform the best overall PAN 2014 entrant by a significant margin. The strength of the BDI
classifiers, however, is twofold: first, they do not really require any training corpus, and second,
the BDI approach is high precision (it yields very few false positives), making it a conservative
classifier whose positive results are reliable (at the cost of more false negatives). This can be
seen clearly in Figure \ref{fig:bdi_o2v} in which the best performing GI classifier is compared to
the manually fitted BDI classifier (results between 11\% and 89\% are left unanswered), using the
same features and metrics. The results for each subcorpus are broken down in more detail in Tables
\ref{tab:bdi} \& \ref{tab:o2v}.

\section{Showcase}\label{sec:showcase}

In this section I refer to two attribution studies I have contributed to, one of which is, at the
time of writing, still in press. These figures are not full summaries of the research, but simply
illustrate some of the features of the BDI method that I believe to be useful. As mentioned above,
the output of the BDI algorithm is a distribution of distances, not a summary statistic. These
examples attempt to show that examining the full distribution conveys extra information and can
improve our intuition and confidence in the analysis.

\begin{figure*}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/bootstrap_lexical_paper.png}
    \caption{A BDI comparison of several works attributed to Ovid using
        lexico-grammatical features (character $n$-grams). The \emph{Consolatio Ad
            Liviam} is now considered to be a first-century interpolation.}
    \label{fig:nux_lex}
\end{figure*}

\begin{figure*}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/bootstrap_poetics_paper.png}
    \caption{A BDI comparison of the same works attributed to Ovid, examining
        poetic/metrical features of Latin dactylic elegy instead of lexical
        features.}
    \label{fig:nux_poet}
\end{figure*}

Figures \ref{fig:nux_lex} \& \ref{fig:nux_poet} are from an analysis of several poems attributed to
Ovid. The aim here was to provide evidence for the genuineness of the \emph{Nux}, but of more
interest in this context is the analysis of the \emph{Consolatio ad Liviam}. The \emph{Consolatio}
was once considered to be a genuine work of Ovid, but is now accepted by most scholars to be a
first-century imitation. By using BDI we attempted to show that metrical technique was a powerful
enough stylistic feature to disambiguate even deliberate imitation from genuine works. In Figure
\ref{fig:nux_lex}, we see the value of visualising distributions where all of the distances are
positive (closer to the candidate author than an imposter), which would be summarised as a
`probability' of 1.0. This figure measures similarity in terms of lexico-grammatical features,
operationalized as character $n$-grams. In fact, as can be seen, although the chunks from the
\emph{Consolatio} are much more like Ovid than they are like any of the distractor poets, they are
\emph{not as much like} Ovid as most of the comparison works. This kind of comparability between
strong matches is very difficult with the standard GI approach. However, in Figure
\ref{fig:nux_poet} which measures metrical features, the difference is clear---the sections from the
\emph{Consolatio} are centered around 0 (or near enough) as compared to the other works where at
least 90\% of the distribution mass is above 0, representing a positive attribution. This result
suggests that the \emph{Consolatio} is not Ovidian, but also that it is not a good stylistic match
for any of the distractor poets (Tibullus, Propertius, and Catullus).

\begin{figure*}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/bdi_bar_paper.png}
    \caption{A BDI comparison of use of Latin function words to match a
        translation of Aristotle's \emph{Rhetorics} to Bartholemew of Messina. Each
        distribution is the full BDI run for one chunk of the work.}
    \label{fig:trans_bar}
\end{figure*}

\begin{figure*}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/bdi_wil_paper.png}
    \caption{A BDI comparison of use of Latin function words to match a
        translation of Aristotle's \emph{Rhetorics} to William of Moerbeke. Each
        distribution is the full BDI run for one chunk of the work.}
    \label{fig:trans_wil}
\end{figure*}

Figures \ref{fig:trans_bar} \& \ref{fig:trans_wil} are from an analysis of translator style,
examining medieval translations from Greek to Latin \cite{Beullens_Haverals_Nagy_2024}. In this
study, a small set of function words was used, in accordance with the well-known theory that
closed-class words are used more unconsciously, and thus are more indicative of individual
preferences than nouns, verbs, and adjectives which are highly affected by genre and topic. Overall,
this was found to be an effective approach. Here, however, I note two more useful properties of the
BDI method. The first is that by splitting the work into smaller chunks, and visualising the
distribution for each chunk we are able to see the degree of stylistic variation in a single
translator. It is also clear from Figure \ref{fig:trans_bar} that some passages are less
`stylistically clear', showing much more pronounced spread---this can be interpreted as greater
sensitivity to the individual feature subsets. Overall, Figure \ref{fig:trans_bar} is centred around
a negative value, indicating that it is significantly more similar to one of the imposter
translators than to Bartholemew. In Figure \ref{fig:trans_wil}, we performed the same process for a
different text that is a translation of the same work (Aristotle's \emph{Rhetoric}) generally
accepted to be by William of Moerbeke. In this case we see the expected result---almost all of the
chunks are fairly strongly centred around a positive value. The strength of the match is not as
clear as in the Ovidian figures, but this is perhaps to be expected, since the amount of style that
a translator brings to a work can be reasonably assumed to be less than that brought by an author
(this is a well studied field; see for example \cite{rybicki2012great} with references).

\section{Future Work}

As can be seen from Figure \ref{fig:bdi_o2v}, predictions from the BDI classifier (after shifting)
cluster strongly at the extremes, with most mis-predictions being high-confidence false negatives.
The Kestemont GI classifier shows the most mis-predictions in the central band (near 0.5), which is
intuitive if the outputs are interpreted as probabilities. The link function from the BDI
distributions to a `probability' in $[0,1]$ is a fairly simple idea, and can almost certainly be
improved to produce a smoother and more statistically more informed distribution across the output
range (perhaps logistic regression, or even empirical distributional statistics). This is left for
future work.

\section{Conclusions}

The most common task in authorship verification work is to positively attribute works to authors. In
this context, although balanced accuracy is not unimportant, precision (fewer false positives) is
often more important than recall. The C@1 metric introduced for the PAN 2014 authorship verification
competition balances overall AUC (false positives and false negatives) with the ability for a
classifier to degrade gracefully when the result is unclear. In general, this is a useful
innovation, particularly in comparison to standard machine-learning classifiers which are obliged to
assign each problem to a discrete class (even if the true author is not one of the available
answers). While the GI method performs extremely well, it seems wasteful to discard the detailed
distance information that is calculated in any case during the bootstrap / voting process.

BDI attempts to address these issues by outputting a full distance distribution which can be
manually inspected. As demonstrated in Section \ref{sec:showcase}, this can be very useful when
comparing results that are all strong matches. When operating as a summary classifier, BDI tends to
be conservative in its positive attributions, showing a false positive rate on the PAN 2014 test
problems of less than 1\% when operating with a score shifter that demanded an 89\% confidence
match. While the raw C@1 results of the BDI vectorizer/classifier/shifter combinations were not as
strong as the best result from updated Kestemont GI, the fitted versions all outperformed the best
PAN 2014 entry, and the more conservative versions (with manual shifting) would all have finished in
the top three. Overall, the BDI approach seems to be a strong choice, especially where training data
is limited and/or reliable positive results are more important than balanced AUC $\times$ C@1
performance.
